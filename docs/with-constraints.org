* with-constraints

core.contracts's ~with-constraints~ macro takes a function followed by one or more contracts and returns a new function that is the amalgamation of them all:

#+begin_src clojure
(def constrained-sqr 
  (with-constraints
    sqr
    sqr-contract))
#+end_src

See the docs of [[./contract/][contract]] for more detail.
